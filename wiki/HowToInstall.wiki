#summary Development Environment Setup Guidelines.

= Introduction =

The project was compiled and tested on Windows XP SP2 machine. Though the OS and IDE is proprietary, the project itself uses only open source third party libraries.

Please report any problem to [borisusun@gmail.com administrator] if you experiencing problems compiling the project on other windows version, or you are interested to port it to a different platform.

In following examples I will refer to "c:\altalena" as project root, path "c:\altalena" and <project root> will be used interchangeably.

3rd parties dependencies usually follows the following pattern

<project root>\<library name>\<library name with version>

The following procedure assumes that you have "clean" machine with no prerequisites installed. It goes without saying, that you may hack project definitions if you'd like to change according it to your file system structure.

= Dependencies =

The library depends on 

# [http://www.boost.org boost] [http://www.boostpro.com/boost_1_34_1_setup.exe boost 1.34.1 1.34.1] - Pre-built libraries are available to download. Download it and update your IDE include and library options.

# Microsoft® DirectX® 9.0 SDK - mediatreamer2 needs this to compile. I used version that may be downloaded from [http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9226a611-62fe-4f61-aba1-914185249413&displaylang=en here].Download it and update your IDE include and library options.

Other project dependencies

are either included into subversion tree completely or by means of subversion externals.

= Setup =

 # Checkout altalena code with secondary 3rd party libraries in <project root>\altalena- see instructions here http://code.google.com/p/altalena/source/checkout. Write to administrator if you want to become a member of development team.

# Unzip the mediastreamer2 library. Important! You should unzip it exactly in the same directory where it is located.
