#summary Development Environment Setup Guidelines.

= Introduction =

The project was compiled and tested on Windows XP SP2 and Vista machines. Though the OS and IDE is proprietary, the project itself uses only open source third party libraries.

Please report any problem to [borisusun@gmail.com], if you are experiencing problems compiling the project on other windows version, or you are interested to port it to a different platform.

Be advised that currently it can be built in debug configuration only.
